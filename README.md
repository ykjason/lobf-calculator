Using linear regression to approximate a line of best fit for any given number of points in the form of linear, quadratic, and cubic graphs.

Because of the varying polynomial growth rate, especially with linear and cubic functions combined, the tool may give inaccurate approximations with a singular chosen growth rate. As such, those variables may need to be adjusted for certain cases or opt out of showing the lower order polynomials.

~~Currently, the tool only takes in points in the order of ascending x values.
Points must also be integers.~~

Points may now be entered in any order and can also be of floating point numbers.
