Using linear regression to approximate a line of best fit for any given number of points in the form of linear, quadratic, and cubic graphs.

Because of the varied growth rates, especially with linear and cubic functions here, the tool may give inaccurate approximations due to a hard-coded growth rate and condition for convergence. As such, those variables may need to be adjusted for certain cases.

Currently, the tool only takes in points in the order of ascending x values.
Points must also be integers.
